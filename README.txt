My contributions to the source code contained in this folder were developed 
for fulfilment of credit towards CSE-511a Introduction to Artificial 
Intelligence at Washington University in St. Louis in the fall of 2015. The
 course was taught by Dr. Roman Garnett and developed at the University of 
California Berkeley (CS188). 

If the reader finds this source code looking to learn from it, but not copy
 or use it in place of their own code for a similar class, they are free to
 it.

I used PyCharm to develop my contributions so there exist workspace files 
in the commit. My contributions are located in the following files:

project1/searchAgents.py
project2/multiAgents.py
project2/mypy.py
project3/analysis.py
project3/qlearningAgents.py
project3/valueIterationAgents.py
project4/inference.py

Much of the credit and work goes to Ethan Glassman, my partner for this project.
